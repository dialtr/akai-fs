# Tasks

## Pending
* Work on run.sh; it should be able to download an iso from somewhere so that
  the potentially large iso file doesn't have to be in the repo. An idea would
  be to have a bootstrap script that would fetch an iso from some site that
  hosts it so that it could remain outside the repo. (It's a 500mb file!)

## Done

* Write new README.md
* Get original code building under CMake.
